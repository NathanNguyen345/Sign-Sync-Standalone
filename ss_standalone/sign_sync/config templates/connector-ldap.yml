# This is a sample configuration file for the ldap connector type.
#
# ldap (lightweight directory access protocol) is a network protocol used by
# most enterprise directory systems (including Active Directory from Microsoft).
#
# This sample file contains all of the settable options for this protocol.
# There is tremendous variation in the user object structure and attribute
# value structure among LDAP directories even within a single enterprise, so
# you will likely have to adapt the value specified here to match those in
# use in your situation.  All of the settings here can be changed, and
# many do not have default values and so are required.  It is recommended
# that you make a copy of this file and edit that to match your configuration.
# While you are at it, you will likely want to remove a lot of this  commentary,
# in order to enhance the readability of your file.

# connection settings (required)
# You must specify all four of these settings.  Consult with your
# enterprise directory administrators to get suitable values.
# These access credentials are sensitive and must be protected.
